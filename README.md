### docker_mirror
Trigger github action to pull the image freely and then push it to the private registry. As a Chinene resident I can't have unrestricted access to dockerHub so I have to do this.<br/>
Populate the variables in the file \.github\workflows\mirror.yaml and push local changes. After that, your desired image can be available from your personal docker registry.
